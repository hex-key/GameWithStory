INSPIRATION:
we wanted to make something we would all be equally passionate about creating, despite our varying skill levels. sam wrote the fateful message "game. with Story [sic]," and the rest is history. gws is also inspired by undertale, you are baba, the rusty lake series, social anxiety disorder, and our experiences as college freshmen.

WHAT IT DOES:
play as a college freshman who's been putting off unpacking for...a normal amount of time. hang up posters!! unrepress your emotions!! and at long last, touch grass!!
